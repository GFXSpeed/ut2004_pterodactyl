# UT2004 Server for Pterodactyl

I couldnt find any eggs for UT2004 so I decided to learn some stuff and create my own

Current version contains: 
  - patched uplink servers for openspy and 333networks
  - download redirect to http://uz2.pwc-networks.com/

Working gametype variables:
  - deathmatch|dm 
  - lastmanstanding|lms
  - teamdeathmatch|tdm
  - onslaught|ons		
  - bombingrun|bomb
  - invasion|inv
  - assault|aslt
  - doubledom|dd
  - mutant|mut
  - capturetheflag|ctf

You can set your wanted mutators in start.sh file. 

Things you may want to add/change: 
  - add a "cdkey" file in ./System/ with your key
  - change Name/Region/MessageOfTheDay in ./System/UT2004.ini, starting at line 292
